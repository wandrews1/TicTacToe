TicTacToe is a Java-based game with a GUI.

The player can choose to play in 1-player mode or 2-player mode.
In 1-player mode, the player challenges the computer.
In 2-player mode, two human players take turns choosing which button they want to press.

1-player: Normal mode: The player clicks and the computer will choose a random button to press.
1-player: Competitive mode: Same as above, but the computer uses a better algorithm providing a smaller chance for the human to win.
2-player: Two humans can take turns choosing their destiny.

Enjoy.
