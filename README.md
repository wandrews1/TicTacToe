## TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a Java-based game with a GUI.

The player can choose to play in 1-player mode or 2-player mode.

- In **1-player mode**, the player challenges the computer.
  - **1-player: Normal mode:** The player clicks and the computer will choose a random button to press.
  - **1-player: Competitive mode:** Same as above, but the computer uses a better algorithm providing a smaller chance for the human to win.
- In **2-player mode**, two human players take turns choosing which button they want to press.
  - **2-player:** Two humans can take turns choosing their destiny.
